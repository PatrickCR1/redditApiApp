Repository of Reddit API Application

Android Code Challenge

The goal is to implement a basic Top Reddits reader. 
You will have 3 days from the moment you receive the challenge to complete and submit the code. After you finish, you will need to share with us the link to your public repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc).
You can use any third-party library and Kotlin/Java to code (although we prefer Kotlin).
The repository should contain a Readme which explains what you have done and all the important information we should know about the reader you have implemented.
We will also evaluate different software engineering aspects of your solution such as architecture, patterns and industry best practices.
Required Features
●	List Top Reddits with thumbnails.
●	Pull to refresh Reddits.
●	Load more Reddits when reaching the end of the list.

You can add any extra feature, that would be highly appreciated. 
Ideas for extra features
●	Support for different device resolutions and orientation.
●	Display Reddit details (only for Reddits with images in PNG and JPG format).
●	Save Reddit image into photo library.
●	Offline mode.
●	Transitions.
